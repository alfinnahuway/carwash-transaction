# Project Description: Vehicle Washing Transaction System

I would like to introduce my project, the Vehicle Washing Transaction System that I have developed. This project was part of my final assignment in my college course. The system combines technology and functionality to simplify the process of recording, payment, and analyzing vehicle washing transactions.

## Key Technologies

- **Programming Language**: PHP
- **Back-End Framework**: CodeIgniter
- **Front-End**: Bootstrap CSS, JavaScript (with jQuery assistance)

## Project Description

The project aims to automate and streamline the vehicle washing process, including transaction recording and customer payments. Some of the main features of this project include:

- **Transaction Recording**: Enables staff to easily record vehicle washing transactions, including service details, customer information, and dates.

- **Payment Processing**: After the washing is completed, the system calculates the transaction cost and provides convenient payment options to customers.

- **Report Management**: The application records daily, monthly, and yearly reports to monitor the progress of transactions, income, and expenses. This eliminates the need for manual ledger entries.

- **Profit and Loss Graphs**: Interactive graphs allow you to view the profit and loss trends based on daily income and expenses.

## Motivation

This project is the culmination of my final assignment in my college course, and I see great potential in developing a tool that can help vehicle washing businesses efficiently monitor their transactions.

## Future Contributions

I plan to continue developing this project by adding more useful features and enhancing the user interface. I also hope to receive feedback and contributions from the development community.
